# Create: Colorful Catalysts
Are you tired of your fluids spilling everywhere when trying to set up a bulk dyeing process?
This add-on solves your problems with 16 handy new blocks. They work exactly as the fluids and can be used for bulk dyeing, but you don't need to worry about spilling liquids everywhere.



Keep in mind that this mod is in early development, and bugs may occur. If you find any, report them to the GitHub linked on this project page.


## Features
- 16 Fan Catalysts, 1 for each colour
- Seamless integration with Create: Connected and Create: Garnished
- Planned and prepared compatibility with Create: Dragons Plus

## How it works
1. Obtain a bucket of dyed mastic resin (Create: Garnished) for all dyes you want
2. Craft empty fan catalysts from Create: Connected in the amount you need (1 per bucket)
3. Place the catalysts down and interact with them while holding the buckets
4. Use a fan to blow or pull air streams and watch the items in it be dyed according to the catalyst's color
